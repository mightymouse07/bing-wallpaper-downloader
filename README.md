# bing-wallpaper-downloader

Simple project to download bing wallpapers. Initial download defaults to 10 images. Subsequent runs will download one image per day since last run. So if the last time I ran was 20 days ago then it will download 20 images.

## Installation

npm install

## Usage

node index.js [path to download files to]

Set your wallpaper to the folder where the downloads go to and enjoy!
